Week 02 - Hilo Game

Player starts with a point balance of 300 points.
Dealer deals a card then asks the player to predict
whether the next card will be higher or lower. If 
the player guesses correctly, the player receives 100
points. If they are inaccurate, 75 points is deducted
from the player's balance. If the balance reaches zero,
the game ends. After each card dealt, the player is asked
if they wish to continue or not. If the score is still
above 0 and they select "y" the game continues. If the
player selects "n" or their score is zero, the game ends.
If the player continues the game long enough to get the deck 
below half of the cards, the deck is reshuffled to resist 
anyone 'counting cards' to aid in guessing.
